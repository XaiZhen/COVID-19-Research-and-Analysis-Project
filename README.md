<h3>About This Project<h3>

<h4>🧑‍⚕️🦠🌍<h4>
<h6></h6>The aim of this research is to examine the current global impact of COVID-19, including an analysis of what factors affect mortality rates, why mortality and infection rates vary widely between countries, how strategies have done between countries for epidemic prevention and control have assisted in their prevention of the spread of COVID-19, and whether vaccination has been effective in preventing the spread of the virus. 
  <br>
In addition, this report will also include an analysis of the effectiveness of existing epidemic prevention methods.
